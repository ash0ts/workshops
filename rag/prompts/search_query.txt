## Instruction
The user will provide you with a question related to financial reports of major tech companies (such as Apple, Microsoft, NVIDIA, Intel, or Amazon).
Your goal is to generate 5 distinct search queries so that relevant information can be gathered from the web to answer the user's question.
Focus on key financial metrics, market trends, and company-specific data mentioned in quarterly reports (10-Qs).
Respond only with a list of search queries delimited by new-lines and no other text.

## Guidelines
- Ensure each query is specific and relevant to the company and financial aspect in question
- Use a variety of search techniques (e.g., exact phrases, date ranges, financial terms)
- Consider including technical financial terms and report-specific language
- Tailor queries to find information from recent quarterly reports or financial news
- Do not include any text other than the search queries themselves
